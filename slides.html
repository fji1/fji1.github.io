### The properties of large psychological assessments (e.g. WJ III, WISC/WAIS IV)
- Multiple tests
- Complicated relations

???
For example, Woodcock-Johnson IV is a wildly used assessment battery that assess both cognitive abilities and academic achievements.

`\(Reading\)` `\(Decoding\)` = `\(b_0\)` + `\(b_1Gc\)` + `\(b_2Phonological\)` `\(Awareness\)` + `\(error\)`

1. Human beings are not born to process probabilistic information e.g. Bayes stats and confusion table (e.g. Type I and Type II errors).
2. e.g2. T test is easy to interpret, one way ANOVA is getting a little bit harder, Three-way ANOVA is even harder.
??? 
The aim of my current project is to solve a common problem that clinicians come across in their day routine.

Just one multiple regression could be misleading

# The commonality of these problems
- Human beings do not combine information of multiple variables well
- Human beings do not reason well with probability

*Move into latent level - even more misleading*

# Solution: Profile Unusualness
1. Quantify profile unusualness by using probabilities
2. Quantify one score/result of test
3. Quantify multiple scores/results of battery
4. Software solution to automate the whole process
???
We could quantify the how unusual we would observe the profile in population

- The Mahalanobis Distance is a generalized multidimensional way to measure the distance between two vectors in standard deviation units. 
$$d_M = \sqrt{(x - \mu)' C^{-1} (x - \mu)  } $$

# Applications
1. Help clinicians understand implications of the model.

2. Identify situations in which more testing is needed.

# Goal of Current Study
1. Choose from different latent score estimation methods to be used in our method

2. Use simulated data to verify the proposed method performs better than wildly-used method

3.	Illustrate how to explain a profile in SEM for individuals to help clinicians make
educated judgments.

4.	Provide software solution to automate the process.

# Goal 1: Comparison of different Latent score estimation methods

1. Thurstone: Regression-based least squares method (Thurstone, 1935)

2. Bartlett's approach: Least squares method with correction of covariance between factors (Bartlett, 1937)

3. Empirical Bayes random effects estimates (Estabrook and Neale 2013)

???
So, for my first goal, we should first notice there are many different ways to estimate latent scores like Thurstone's, Bartlett's and Bayes'.
For the goal of this thesis, we should pick up the one that can produce most *validity*.
*Difference between Regression Scores and Sum/`Weighted Sum`*
Thurstone (1935) used a least squares regression
approach to predict factor score(s). Regression factor
scores predict the location of each individual on the
factor or component. This procedure differs from the
non-refined weighted sum method, in that the weighed
sum non-refined procedure reflects the extent to which
the factor or component estimated is manifested by each
individual case; the method does not use an underlying
model to predict an "optimal" factor score.

*Regression Scores*
Following regression terminology, with this
method, independent variables in the regression
equation are the standardized observed values of the
items in the estimated factors or components. These
predictor variables are weighted by regression
coefficients, which are obtained by multiplying the
inverse of the observed variable correlation matrix by
the matrix of factor loadings and, in the case of oblique
factors, the factor correlation matrix. 

*Batlett*
Bartlett factor scores are computed by multiplying
the row vector of observed variables, by the inverse of
the diagonal matrix of variances of the unique factor
scores, and the factor pattern matrix of loadings.
Resulting values are then multiplied by the inverse of the
matrix product of the matrices of factor loadings and the
inverse of the diagonal matrix of variances of the unique
factor scores

*EBA*

### Goal 2: Comparison between proposed method and wildly-used method in terms of clinical decison making

- Monte Carlo simulation to validate if the proposed method overperforms the wildly used method
- Unusualness: based on Latent scores vs. based on composite scores/FSIQ
---
# Goal 3: Working exmaple illustration

- For one individual test scores, how should we make use of our proposed method to explain test results and make clinical decision?

---
## Goal 4: Provide software solution to automate the process 
- R Package 

```r
library("lavaan")
*library("Proposed Package")
model &lt;- 'Gc =~ Gc1 + Gc2 + Gc3
          Gf =~ Gf1 + Gf2 + Gf3
          Gs =~ Gs1 + Gs2 + Gs3
          RD ~~ Gc + Gf + Gs
          RC ~~ Cc + Gf + Gs + RD
          Rf ~~ Gc + Gf + Gs + RD + RC
          '
fit &lt;- sem(model, data=PoliticalDemocracy)#a sem object
#overwrite summary function
summary(obj)
#produce the estimated latent scores and associated ci
*profileProb(obj, given = )
#print unusualness scores (m distance and associated probs)
```

???
Returning to the IQ, reading and math score question example, we can find the unusualness by calculating d_cM and form `\(\chi^2\)` distribution to understand how unusual the observed individual profile is in a population.
For a more complicated example (see Figure 1), which illustrates the relations between the measures of outcome variables (i.e. Decoding, Reading Comprehension and Reading Fluency) and potential explanatory variables (i.e. Crystallized Intelligence (Gc), Fluid intelligence (Gf), Processing Speed (Gs)) in a structural equation model. With `\(d_cM\)`,we will be able to know the unusualness of the profile of measures of outcome variables given the potential explanatory variables.
